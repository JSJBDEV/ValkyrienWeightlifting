In this very serious mod, the player can press a keybind (default caps lock) to pick up any block in the world, or any valkyrien ship, however this will only work if you have enough strength to do so. You start with 100kg of strength, and gain 1/4 of the mass of an item in strength when you pick something up.

You can test your strength with a Strength Tester, crafted with an Iron block, black concrete powder and red concrete powder. You can craft a scale to measure (ships) weight with a Iron block and black concrete powder.

Additionally you can push ships. you will have to reconfigure this keybind
